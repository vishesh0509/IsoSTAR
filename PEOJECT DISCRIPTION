This paper gives an analysis and implementation to help the people who are handicapped and cannot
drive their own vehicle. Thereby in future, they drive their own vehicle with a greater safety from
sudden hit-and-run cases due to automatic braking or slow down feature. An Arduino interfacing with
Bluetooth module is to provide the communication channel with device through which we will give the
voice commands. For the circuitry, programmed Arduino will give the control over the motors that use
to run therobotic vehicle. Ultrasonic sensors interfaced with the Arduino help in automatic slowdown or
braking of a vehicle on sudden obstacle detection, and after a delay, it will help in the avoidance of the
obstacle. In future, this concept might prove to be the milestone in vehicle automation, and for longï¿¾
distance range, Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) technology can be useful to control the vehicles on
voice commands, remotely sitting at a single place.

INTRODUCTION
This proposal focuses in the problems faced by specially abled people who wish to drive to their own
vechicle on their own but they cannot because of the natural cause. In this proposed project, the
emphasis is on voice control of robot with automatic braking, speed slow down and avoidance of
obstacles automatically or manually (through voicecommand).In this model, we will use an android app
to pass on the voice commands to the Arduino through Bluetooth communication using Bluetooth
module. Ultrasonic sensor will act as the obstacle detector, which will act as a mediator for Arduino
microcontroller (or the CPU) and the proximal environment, and it would eventually lead to slowing
down the vehicle or to fully break its motion. An LCD will display the proximity of the obstacle, and if the
proximity would reach to a threshold limit, a buzzer will beep up through the processing of the
programme that Arduino would do.
